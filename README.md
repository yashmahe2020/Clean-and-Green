# Clean and Green AI

Environmental AI research project focusing on waste classification and conversational sustainability assistants.

## 🌍 Project Scope
This repository houses research notebooks and prototypes for leveraging Computer Vision and Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve environmental challenges.

## 📂 Components
### 1. Conversational AI (`nb/`)
- **Notebook**: `Llama3.2_(1B_and_3B)-Conversational.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Fine-tuning and testing Llama 3.2 models (1B and 3B parameters) for sustainability-focused dialogue.

### 2. Waste Classification (`waste-classify/`)
- **Goal**: Developing computer vision models to automatically identify and categorize waste types (Recyclable, Organic, Hazardous).

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **Models**: Llama 3.2, Custom CNNs (MobileNet/ResNet)
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started
Open the notebooks in Google Colab or a local Jupyter environment to replicate the experiments.
